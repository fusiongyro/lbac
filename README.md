# Let's Build a Compiler! Markup edition

This is a port of Jack Crenshaw's highly esteemed compiler tutorial. For more information about the book, see [Chapter 1: Introduction](http://www.7gf.org/compilers/tutor1.html) or [readme-original.md](readme-original.md).

My objectives are quite simple:

 - Convert the original textual sources to Markdown format.
 - Convert the Markdown into DocBook.
 - Produce a nice looking HTML version and a nice looking PDF.

It is my hope that a nicely formatted version such as this one will be somewhat more accessible to modern readers than the plain text original.

Copyright on this project belongs to Jack Crenshaw, who is graciously permitting me to share this work publicly. I have been working on this very sporadically for a few years now. Hopefully soon a complete HTML formatted edition will be realized.
